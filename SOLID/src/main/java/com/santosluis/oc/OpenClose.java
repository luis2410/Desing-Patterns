/*
The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.

Advantages
Maintainability: Reduces the risk of introducing new bugs in existing code by avoiding modifications.
Scalability: Allows the system to grow by adding new functionality through extensions rather than changes.
Reusability: Promotes reusable code components that can be extended and customized.
